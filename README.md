# 6ify
This is an ES6 seed project (and an oddly named one now that I think about it...) that uses gulp, babel, jspm and Browser Sync.

This project assumes you already have Node and NPM installed on your system. The following steps will get you running from there...

1. First, install jspm CLI tools by installing jspm globally
    ```
    npm install jspm -ga
    ```
   
2. Clone this project (either leave off the 'your-new-directory' part or name it something else)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/chrisjordanme/6ify.git your-new-directory
    ```
    
3. Now go into that directory and run npm & jspm install
    ```
    cd your-new-directory && npm install && jspm install
    ```
  
3. Start your engines...
    ```
    gulp
    ```
